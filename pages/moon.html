                        The Moon is the only <a href="natural-satellite.html">natural satellite</a> orbiting <a href="earth.html">Earth</a>. 
                        It is also the only natural astronomic body other than Earth that has been visited by people. 
                        It is the fifth largest satellite in the Solar System and is the largest relative to it's parent planet. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        The Moon has no magnetic field, a hydrosphere, or a significant athmosphere.
                        Instead, it is heavily cratered and contains multiple valleys known as "maria" formed by cooling of the Moon during formation.
                        The Moon was likely formed when a protoplanet (called Theia) collided with Earth 4.5 billion years ago.

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        The Moon has been visited by multiple spacecraft.
                        The first object to do so was Luna 2.
                        During the Apollo program, 12 men landed on the moon.
                        Currently the Artemis program is going to land people almost fifty years after the last Apollo mission.

                <h2 class="paragraphheader" id="Formation">Formation</h2>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    The leading theory of the formation of the Moon is that a protoplanet around the size of Mars collided with Earth.
                    The debris were ejected outside Earth and compressed into a molten magma-covered Moon.
                    With time, the magma cooled down, forming the crust.
                    The Lunar maria were produced by this process.
                    The remaining features are impact craters from meteorites.
                </p>
                <h2 class="paragraphheader" id="Orbit">Orbit</h2>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    The Moon is 384,400 km away from <a href="earth.html">Earth</a> on average with a perigee of 362,600 km and an apogee of 405,400 km.
                    The eccentricity of the Moon's orbit is 0.05.
                    The Moon is tidally locked to the Earth and rotates around Earth and around its axis with the same rate.
                    This makes one side of the Moon visible - the near side, while the far side (also misleadingly called "dark side") is invisible from Earth.
                    A synodic orbital period of the moon is 29.53 Earth days.
                    This period is approximately 1/12 of a year on Earth and is used as a reference in Lunar calendars.
                    A sidereal orbital period is 27.32 days.
                </p>
                <h3 class="paragraphsubheader" id="Phases">Phases</h3>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    During the synodic orbital period, the moon completes a cycle of phases.
                    Those phases are determined by the position of the Moon relative to the Sun and Earth.
                    When the moon is between the Sun and Earth, a new moon appears.
                    It is invisible to the naked eye, except during solar eclipses.
                    New moon is followed by a waxing crescent, growing up to a half illuminated near side - first quarter.
                    First quarter is then followed by a waxing gibbous (between half and fully illuminated near side) and a full moon, which is seen as fully illuminated.
                    A full moon is followed by a waning gibbous, a third quarter and a waning crescent before it completes the cycle with a new moon.
                </p>
                <h3 class="paragraphsubheader" id="Eclipses">Eclipses</h3>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    There are two types of eclipses seen from Earth - a solar and a lunar.
                    During a solar eclipse, the moon is in its new moon phase and is covering the Sun.
                    When the moon is completely covering the Sun, it is called a total solar eclipse.
                    From Earth the Moon appears as big as the Sun, so it can almost perfectly hide it in a total solar eclipse.
                    A lunar eclipse occurs when a full moon is in the shadow of Earth and gets little to no sunlight.
                    There are three types of lunar eclipses.
                    A penumbral eclipse occurs when the Moon is in Earth's penumbra (the shadow partially obstructed from sunlight).
                    A partial lunar eclipse is seen when a part of the Moon is in Earth's umbra (shadow fully obstructing the sunlight)
                    A total lunar eclipse has the Moon within Earth's umbra in it's entirety.
                    The Moon appears red during the total eclipse similarly to a rising and setting sun.
                </p>

                <p class="paragraph">
                    The Moon is 3.7 times smaller than Earth, with a mean radius of 1,737.4 km.
                    It has a similar structure to Earth.
                    The core is divided into a solid inner and a liquid outer core, composed of iron and some nickel.
                    The mantle is made of iron-rich silicates like olivine and pyroxene and the crust has lighter minerals.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    The near side of the Moon features most of the Lunar maria - valleys, formed by lava cooling.
                    They have a darker color than the rest of the surface.
                    Some of these maria are Mare Imbrium, Oceanus Procellarum, Mare Crisium, Mare Frigoris, Mare Cognitum, Mare Tranquillitatis, Mare Fecunditatis and more.
                    The rest of the surface is lighter and covered with craters.
                    The largest impact basin is the South Pole-Aitken basin, which is one of the biggest known impact craters.
                    Most of the Lunar maria basins are located in a impact basin, the biggest of which is Imbrium (Procellarum is not confirmed to be an impact basin.)
                    Other craters include Tycho, Schrödinger basin, Van De Graaf, etc.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    The moon has a very thin exosphere and contains ice water.
                    During the Chandrayaan-1 mission the first evidences of water on the Moon were found.
                    Subsequent missions further proved those discoveries.
                    Water ice on the Moon is concentrated around the poles within deep shadowy impact craters.
