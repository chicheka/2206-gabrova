                    Earth is a <a href="planet.html">planet</a> in the Solar System.
                    It is the third planet from the Sun and the biggest of the terrestrial planets.
                    It is the only place that is known to harbor life.
                    Earth has one natural satellite - Moon.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    It contains liquid water on 71% of the surface and the remaining 29% is land.
                    The crust is made up of several tectonic plates that create the various features on Earth's surface - mountain ranges, volcanoes, trenches and cause earthquakes.
                    The liquid outer core of the Earth is responsible for the magnetosphere, which protects from solar and cosmic radiation.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    The athmosphere of Earth is made up of 78% nitrogen and 21% oxygen, with the remaining 1% consisting of other gases like argon and carbon dioxide.
                    Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases capture part of the energy from the Sun.
                    Those gases increase every year due to human activity, resulting in rising average temperatures.
                    Water vapors form clouds in the athmosphere as a part of the water cycle.

            <p class="paragraph">
                Like other planets in the Solar System, the oldest Earth material dates back to 4.5 billion years.
                It is believed that Earth was formed by a protoplanetary disc collapsing.
                Million years after that, a protoplanet called Theia collided with Earth and formed the Moon in the process.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Earth's surface gradually cooled and a solid crust formed. 
                Ice was brought by comets and other object, which turned into oceans by the volcanic activity.

            <h2 class="paragraphheader" id="FormationOfLife">Formation of life</h2>
                Between four and three and a half billion years ago the first life forms appeared.
                Multiple theories exist on how life on Earth formed.

                <h3 class="paragraphsubheader" id="SpontaneousSpawning">Spontaneous spawning</h3>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Spontaneous spawning is an ancient theory, first mentioned by Aristotle.
                    According to him, lower life forms formed from decaying organic matter.
                    In 1668 Francesco Redi conducted an experiment, in which meat was left rotting, to see if maggots appeared, but none did, disproving the theory.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Another ancient theory dates back to Anaxagoras in the 5th century BC.
                    It states that life exist throughout the universe and was brought to Earth by comets and asteroids.
                    This theory does not mention how life formed, only the method it was carried to Earth.

                <h3 class="paragraphsubheader" id="PrimordialSoup">Primordial soup</h3>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    In 19th century several people proposed that life might have formed from inorganic compounds.
                    In 1924 Alexander Oparin and later in 1929 J. B. S. Haldane stated that the molecules constituting cells slowly self-organised from a so-called "primordial soup".
                    Chemists Stanley Miller and Harold Urey successfuly simulated such conditions in 1952.
