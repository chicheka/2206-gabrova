                    Earth is a <a href="planet.html">planet</a> in the Solar System.
                    It is the third planet from the Sun and the biggest of the terrestrial planets.
                    It is the only place that is known to harbor life.
                    Earth has one natural satellite - Moon.

                    It contains liquid water on 71% of the surface and the remaining 29% is land.
                    The crust is made up of several tectonic plates that create the various features on Earth's surface - mountain ranges, volcanoes, trenches and cause earthquakes.
                    The liquid outer core of the Earth is responsible for the magnetosphere, which protects from solar and cosmic radiation.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    The athmosphere of Earth is made up of 78% nitrogen and 21% oxygen, with the remaining 1% consisting of other gases like argon and carbon dioxide.
                    Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases capture part of the energy from the Sun.
                    Those gases increase every year due to human activity, resulting in rising average temperatures.
                    Water vapors form clouds in the athmosphere as a part of the water cycle.

                Like other planets in the Solar System, the oldest Earth material dates back to 4.5 billion years.
                It is believed that Earth was formed by a protoplanetary disc collapsing.
                Million years after that, a protoplanet called Theia collided with Earth and formed the Moon in the process.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Earth's surface gradually cooled and a solid crust formed. 
                Ice was brought by comets and other object, which turned into oceans by the volcanic activity.

            <h2 class="paragraphheader" id="FormationOfLifeTheories">Formation of life theories</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Between four and three and a half billion years ago the first life forms appeared.
                Multiple theories exist on how life on Earth formed.
            </p>
            <h3 class="paragraphsubheader" id="SpontaneousSpawning">Spontaneous spawning</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Spontaneous spawning is an ancient theory, first mentioned by Aristotle.
                According to him, lower life forms formed from decaying organic matter.
                In 1668 Francesco Redi conducted an experiment, in which meat was left rotting, to see if maggots appeared, but none did, disproving the theory.

            <p class="paragraph">
                Another ancient theory dates back to Anaxagoras in the 5th century BC.
                It states that life exist throughout the universe and was brought to Earth by comets and asteroids.
                This theory does not mention how life formed, only the method it was carried to Earth.

            <h3 class="paragraphsubheader" id="PrimordialSoup">Primordial soup</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">
                In 19th century several people proposed that life might have formed from inorganic compounds.
                In 1924 Alexander Oparin and later in 1929 J. B. S. Haldane stated that the molecules constituting cells slowly self-organised from a so-called "primordial soup".
                Chemists Stanley Miller and Harold Urey successfuly simulated such conditions in 1952.

            <h2 class="paragraphheader" id="EvolutionOfLife">Evolution of life</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Over the course of more than three billion years, life has evolved slowly, changing Earth's environment. 
                Photosynthesizing life enriched the atmosphere with oxygen and multicellular organisms appeared. 
                After the emergence of vertebrate organisms, fish quickly developed, and from them - the first amphibians evolved, which were the first to leave the oceans. 
                There were many mass extinction, the most recent occuring 66 million years ago, when a massive asteroid wiped out most non-avian life and especially dinosaurs. 
                Smaller mammals survived the impact and among those, apes gained abilities like upright standing and tool bearing. 
                They are members of the class Homo, which evolved into the modern-day humans.

            <p class="paragraph">
                Earth is a nearly spherical body with an average diameter of 12,742 km. 
                This makes Earth the fifth biggest planet in the Solar System. 
                Altitude on Earth is measured relatively to the sea level of 0 m. 
                The lowest point is Challenger Deep - 10,925 m and the highest is mount Everest - 8,848 m. 
                Due to Earth's rotation, the lands around the Equator are farther from the cener than the poles.

            <p class="paragraph">
                Most of the water on Earth is in it's liquid phase. 
                About 71.8% of Earth's surface is covered by ocean. 
                The world ocean is divided into five smaller oceans - Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern and Arctic ocean.
                These oceans contain a continential shelf, mid-ocean ridges, mountains, volcanoes, trenches, canyons and plateaus.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                The land takes up only 29.2% of the surface. 
                It consists of four main landmasses and many smaller islands.
                The landmasses - Afroeurasia, America, Antarctica and Australia make up the continents.
                Just like the oceans, many landforms shape up the land surface - mountains, plateaus, plains, volcanoes and many more.

            <p class="paragraph">
                The crust is the outermost geologic layer of Earth, separated from the mantle by the Mohorovičić discontinuity.
                It is  divided into continental and oceanic depending on the surface. 
                While the continental crust contains more low-density igneous rocks like granite, oceanic crust has more basalt.
                Both are covered by a layer of sedimentray rocks, which are accumulated and compressed sediments.
                Igneous and sedimentary rocks can change into metamorphic rocks through high pressure or temperatures.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                The mantle is a dense layer of rock in the interior of the Earth.
                It is divided into upper, consisting mostly of olivine and pyroxene and lower mantle, consisting of magnesium perovskite.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                The innermost layer is the core of Earth. 
                It is split into a liquid outer core and a solid inner core.
                The core consists of iron and nickel and is responsible for the magnetosphere around Earth.
