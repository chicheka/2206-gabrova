                    Mars is the fourth <a href="planet.html">planet</a> from the Sun and the second smallest in the Solar System.   
                    Mars is named after the Roman god of war. 
                    It is also known as the Red Planet, the name originating from it's red surface.
                    The planet has a similar composition to that of <a href="earth.html">Earth</a>, but with a thinner atmosphere.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Mars features some of the largest geological structures in the Solar System like the highest known mountain - Olympus Mons (21,229 m) and the largest canyon Valles Marineris. 
                    Craters are mostly concentrated in the south, where the surface is older, the biggest of which is Utopia, although the unconfirmed North Polar Basin is bigger. 
                    There is ice on Mars, most of which is at the poles, with evidences showing that liquid water might have existed at one point on the Martian surface.
                    Currently no liquid water can remain on the surface, due to the low athmospheric pressure. 
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    There are two satellites orbiting around Mars - Phobos and Deimos.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Mars has been visited by multiple spacecraft, the first success being NASA's Mariner 4.
                    Other countries have sent their missions, including the Soviet Union (and later Russia), Japan, China and the UAE.
                    European countries under ESA have also sent missions.
                    Only the USA, the Soviet Union and China have successfully sent a lander, although the soviet Mars 3 lost connection shortly after landing.

                <h2 class="paragraphheader" id="Name">Name</h2>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    The first to name the planet were the Sumerians, giving it the name of the god of war and plague Nergal.
                    In Ancient Greece, the planet was known as "Pyroeis" (Πυρόεις), or "Areos aster" (Ἄρεως ἀστἡρ), after the Greek god of war Ares.
                    The modern Greek name is Ares (Άρης).
                    The Romans also named it after their god of war Mars.
                    In India the planet is called Mangala (मंगल), which is the god-personification of the planet.
                    In China and neighboring countries the planet is refered to as "fire star" (火星).

                    Mars has an orbit with a semimajor axis of 1.524 AU and an eccentricity of 0.0934, second only to <a href="mercury.html">Mercury</a>. 
                    The planet orbits the Sun in 687 days.
                    The perihelion is 1.3814 AU and the aphelion is 1.666 AU.

                    The martian solar day (called sol) is 24 hours, 39 minutes, and 35.244 seconds.
                    The axial tilt is 25.19°, which is close to that of Earth and thus has similar seasons.

                    Mars has an interior similar to that of Earth. 
                    It is differentiated into a crust, a rocky mantle and a metallic core.
                    The crust contains mostly silicates, with common elements being (apart from silicon and oxygen) iron, magnesium and aluminium.
                    The iron(III) oxide (ferric oxide) gives Mars it's red color.
                    The Martian mantle is solid and rocky, but is not divided like Earth's inner and outer mantle.
                    The core contains iron, nickel and sulfur.

                    Mars is seismically active, but does not feature tectonic plates like Earth.
                    There are two major volcanic regions - Tharsis and Elysium.
                    Tharsis is a region, containing most of the volcanoes on Mars.
                    Tharsis Montes, a group of three mountains - Ascraeus Mons, Pavonis Mons and Arsia Mons - is located in the center of Tharsis.
                    Other prominent mountains are Alba Mons and Olympus Mons, which is the highest mountain known at 21,229 m above datum.
                    Elysium is located west of Tharsis, both separated by Amazonis Planitia.
                    The tallest mountain is Elysium Mons at 14.1 km above the datum.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Valles Marineris, named after Mariner 9, is a canyon east from Tharsis.
                    It is long 4,000 km, wide 200 km and deep 7 km, making it the biggest known canyon in the Solar System.
                    Many theories exist on what might have caused it's formation, like a tectonic rift, or formed by erosion by liquid water.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    The Martian surface is heavily cratered, but most craters are located in the south.
                    The north contains interconnected low-lying plains like Arcadia Planitia, Acidalia Planitia and Utopia Planitia.
                    This suggests that these plains may have once been covered by a large Martian ocean.
                    Another big plain is Hellas Planitia, which is not connected to the other and is located in the south hemisphere.
                    This is where the lowest point on Mars is.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Dark spots on Mars like Syrtis Major are albedo features significantly darker than the surrounding terrain.
                    The dark colors come from the basaltic volcanic rock of the regions and the relative lack of dust.
