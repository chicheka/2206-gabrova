            <p class="paragraph">Planets are round astronomical bodies, smaller than <a href="star.html">stars</a>.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">According to the IAU, a planet is a celestial body that:</p>
            <ol class="paragraph">
                <li>is in orbit around the Sun,</li>
                <li>has sufficient mass so it assumes hydrostatic equilibrium (to be nearly round) and</li>
                <li>has cleared the neighborhood around it's orbit.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="paragraph">
                There are 8 planets in the Solar System - <a href="mercury.html">Mercury</a>, <a href="venus.html">Venus</a>, <a href="earth.html">Earth</a>, <a href="mars.html">Mars</a>, <a href="jupiter.html">Jupiter</a>, <a href="saturn.html">Saturn</a>, <a href="uranus.html">Uranus</a> and <a href="neptune.html">Neptune</a>. 
                The first four are known as terrestrial planets, Jupiter and Saturn are called gas giants and Uranus and Neptune are ice giants.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Other objects used to be considered planets, but were later considered as completely different bodies. 
                For example, the Sun was considered a planet orbiting the Earth, but was later discovered that it is a star. 
                The <a href="natural-satellite.html">satellites</a> of planets like Earth's Moon, or the Jovian, Saturnian, Uranian and Neptunian moons were also considered planets for some time.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                The same can be said for the asteroids in the <a href="asteroid-belt.html">Asteroid Belti</a>, or objects like Pluto. 
                The biggest asteroid - Ceres, the <a href="tno.html">Trans-Neptunian objects</a> Pluto, Eris, Haumea, Makemake and many more are called dwarf planets. 
                The difference is that unlike regular planets, dwarf planets do not make up the majority of the mass in their orbit.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                There are also many more known planets that exist outside our Solar System, known as <a href="exoplanet.html">exoplanets</a>. 
                Currently, there are more than 5 000 known exoplanets.

            <h2 class="paragraphheader" id="DiscoveryOfThePlanets">Discovery of the planets</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">
                In ancient times, in addition to the Earth, five of the planets were known to man, as they were close enough to be observed with the naked eye. 
                Those five, the Sun and the Moon were the "seven classical planets". 
                The term planet comes from the Ancient Greek word "πλανῆται" (planetai), meaning "wanderers", refering to their movement in the sky.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                In the XVI century, the polish astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus presented a mathematical model of a heliocentric system, where planets revolved around the Sun. 
                This meant that in addition to Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn, Earth was also a planet, while the Sun and the Moon weren't.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                In 1781, William Herschel discovered a new planet - Uranus, adding a seventh planet. 
                The next century saw the discovery of many new "planets", but were later categorised as a new class of bodies - asteroids. 
                The last planet discovered was Neptune in 1846.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                There were speculations, that a ninth planet existed. 
                In 1930 this planet was believed to be the newly discovered Pluto. 
                But after the discovery of many smaller objects beyond Neptune, Pluto's satellite Charon and a "tenth" planet Eris with it's moon Dysnomia lead to the 2006 definition by the International Astronomical Union of what a planet is. 
                According to it, Pluto, Eris and the other objects didn't meet the last criteria - to "clear the neighborhood", or in other words - to make up most of the mass within their orbits.

                    It is the brightest of the planets on the Earth sky. 
                    The Venusian surface has a higher temperature than Mercury, due to the greenhouse effect caused by the carbon dioxide-rich athmosphere.

                    Craters are mostly concentrated in the south, where the surface is older. 
                    There is ice on Mars and evidences show that liquid water might have existed on the Martian surface, but is currently impossible, due to the low athmospheric pressure. 
                    There are two satellites orbiting around Mars - Phobos and Deimos.

                    It is named after the Greek god, who represents the sky. 
                    Uranus, just like the other ice giant Neptune, consists of volatiles (ices), whereas the gas giants are mostly made up of hydrogen and helium. 
                    Just like the other giants, Uranus has a ring system. 
                    Its axis of rotation is tilted sideways, nearly into the plane of its solar orbit. 
                    27 moons are known to exist, all named after characters from plays by Shakespeare and "The Rape of the Lock" by Alexander Pope. 
                    The biggest five are Titania, Oberon, Umbriel, Ariel and Miranda.

                    The smallest giant, Neptune is the last planet in the Solar System. 
                    It is named after the Roman sea god. 
                    It has a ring system and had a Great Dark Spot, similar to the Great Red Spot of Jupiter. 
                    There are 14 known satellites, named after Greek water deities. 
                    The biggest satellite - Triton, is believed to be a dwarf planet caught by the gravitation of Neptune.

                    Dwarf planets are objects similar to planets. 
                    The difference is that unlike regular planets, dwarf planets do not make up the majority of the mass in their orbit apart from their satellites.

                    The objects that lead to the IAU's definition of dwarf planets are Pluto, Eris and Ceres. 
                    Haumea and Makemake were later added to the group of dwarf planets defined by the IAU. 
                    Other astronomers also include other <a href="tno.html">TNOs</a> to the list - Gonggong, Quaoar, Sedna and Orcus. 
                    These nine are widely refered to as dwarf planets, even though some of them are not proven to be in hydrostatic equilibrium (to be round enough). 
                    Other objects that might be dwarf planets are Salacia, Varda, Ixion, Gǃkúnǁʼhòmdímà and Varuna.

                Exoplanets are planets orbiting <a href="star.html">stars</a> different from the Sun. 
                There are more than 5,000 known exoplanets.

            <p class="paragraph">
                The closest exoplanets are located 4.2 light-years from Earth and orbit Proxima Centauri, the closest star to Earth.
