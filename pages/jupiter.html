                    Jupiter is the largest <a href="planet.html">planet</a> in the Solar System and fifth from the Sun.
                    It is one of two gas giants, composed of hydrogen and helium, with trace amounts of methane, ammonia, ethane and water.
                    It is named after the king of gods and god of the sky in Roman mythology, analogous to Zeus in greek mythology.

                    The most recognisable feature is the massive Great Red Spot - a long-lasting storm in the atmosphere of Jupiter. 
                    It has a faint ring and at least 80 <a href="natural-satellite.html">moons</a>.
                    The four main ones are Ganymede, Callisto, Io and Europe, first discoverd by Galileo in 1610.

                    Multiple spacecrafts have visited Jupiter, two of which have orbited around it.
                    Pioneer 10 and 11, Voyager 1 and 2 and New Horizons used Jupiter's gravity for accelerating beyond it's orbits to achieve the velocity required to leave the Solar System.
                    Juno is an ongoing mission, studying the atmosphere, deep structure and magnetosphere.
                    Future missions include ESA's JUICE, NASA's Europa Clipper and CNSA's Tianwen-4.

                Jupiter is named after the Roman god Jupiter.
                In Greek, the planet is named after Zeus (Δίας), the greek equivalent of Jupiter.
                It's original name in ancient Greece was Phaeton (Φαέθων, "shining one").
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                In Chinese, Japanese and neighboring countries the planet is refered to as "wood star" (木星).
                In Vedic astrology, the planet is named after Brihaspati (बृहस्पति), the "guru of devas" or teacher of gods.

                Jupiter orbits 5.2 AU away from the Sun, 4.95 AU during perihelion and 5.46 AU during aphelion.
                It takes 11.86 Earth years to complete an orbit.
                The orbital plane of Jupiter is inclined 1.30° compared to the ecliptic and has an eccentricity of 0.049.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Jupiter's axial tilt is only 3.13°.
                Jupiter rotates the fastest of all the planets, completing a rotation in ten hours on average.
                This makes the planet more flattened than other planets at 6.8% flattening, with only <a href="saturn.html">Saturn</a> having a higher percent.
                Just like other giants, Jupiter observes a differential rotation.
                The Jovian poles rotate slower, rotating 5 minutes longer than the equator.

                Jupiter is the largest planet in the Solar System.
                It has a diameter 11.2 times that of <a href="earth.html">Earth</a> and one tenth of the Sun.
                <a href="exoplanet.html">Exoplanets</a> that are gas giants are similar to Jupiter and are therefore called "Jupiters".
                A "hot Jupiter" is a class of gas giant exoplanets that orbit close to the Sun, examples include Dimidium (51 Pegassi b), WASP-12b, HD 209458 b and WASP-19b.

                They were discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610 and are called Galilean moons. 
                Ganymede is the largest known satellite and is bigger than <a href="mercury.html">Mercury</a>. 
                All but Europa are larger than Earth's Moon. 
                Io, Europa and Ganymede are in a 4:2:1 orbital resonance with each other.

            <p class="paragraph">
                76 other moons are known to orbit Jupiter. 
                Just like the four Galilean moons, the rest are assigned names of lovers of Zeus (Greek equivalent of Jupiter) and later their descendants. 
                They are significantly smaller than the Galilean moons. 
                The biggest of them is Amalthea, and the most massive is Himalia.

                    It is larger than the planet <a href="mercury.html">Mercury</a>, but is less massive.
                    The Hubble Space Telescope has discovered evidence for underground saltwater ocean.
                    It has a magnetic field, the only satellite known to have such.
                    The magnetic field is likely affected by the interior ocean.

                    It is volcanically active and has hundreds of volcanoes.
                    The activity of Io is caused by the gravitational pull of Jupiter on one side and Ganymede and Europa on the other side.
                    Together these three satellites are in a orbital resonance with each other.
                    Volcano eruptions can be so powerful that Earth telescopes can see them.

                    It is an icy moon with a smooth surface full of dark streaks.
                    It is speculated that Europa could have a subsurface ocean where extraterrestrial life could exist.
                    This is similar to Ganymede and Callisto, but there are more evidences showing such ocean on Europa than on the other two moons.
                    A similar satellite is <a href="saturn.html">Saturn</a>'s moon Enceladus.
                    NASA is planning to launch the orbiter Europa Clipper in 2024 to study the Europan surface.
